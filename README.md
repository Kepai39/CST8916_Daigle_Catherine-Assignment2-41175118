## Scenario Description:
The Rideau Canal Skateway is a canal in Ottawa that throughout the winter season, allows the public to skate onto the frozen ice within the canal making it one of Ottawa's largest skating attractions.  The issue is that given global warming and the skateway being a canal, the National Capital Commission (NCC) must determine whether the canal is safe enough for the general public to skate on or close the canal for the rest of the winter.  This issue can be solved by placing IoT sensors within the canal to measure the following:

Ice Thickness (in cm)  - to ensure the public does not fall into thin ice.
Surface Temperature (in Celsius) - To determine if the ice is melting
Snow Accumulation (in cm) - Cannot skate skate in heavy snow as well as weakens the ice structure.
External Temperature (in Celsius) - Determines in general if it is safe to skate in the canal outside


The analyzation and processing of this data as well as visualizing the data in an understandable way will notify the NCC to determine the appropriate  measures taken to open the canal without risking public safety.  With IoT sensors, information about the canal's condition can be determined in real-time allowing the NCC to make specific conditions when opening the canal.  For example, the NCC may open the canal on a day they deemed safe and close the canal the next day, or they may close certain sections of the canal they deem too unsafe for the public.  With real-time monitoring the NCC can issue warnings or determine appropriate actions with sudden changes of the weather.
